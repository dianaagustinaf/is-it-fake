                    <p>
                        Fake news is misleading information deliberately spread as “news” typically online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is an important difference between fake news and simply inaccurate reporting:
                        fake news implies that the <b>misinformation is absolutely deliberate</b>.

                    <p>
                        If fake news could be distinguished from real news then the spread
                        of misinformation would reduce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is why we have built supervised machine learning models
                        and deep learning models using <b>Natural Language Programming</b> (NLP)
                        to predict whether the news is real or fake.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why Machine Learning?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Biased software on internet and social media platforms has only amplified Fake News 
                        so we decided to use Machine Learning, 
                        specifically NLP algorithms to counteract this. 
                    </p> -->
                    <p>
                        <b>Fake News detection requires only Natural Language Understanding</b>. NLU is
                        a sub-category of NLP that gives computers the ability to understand the meaning
                        of a piece of text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope this technology could be widely used in future to detect and
                        flag fake news and disinformation.

                    <p>
                        We used the Fake News Detection dataset from a
                        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaggle's Fake News Detection Competition</a>.
                        And we decided on this dataset as it was the most balanced and complete dataset we could find
                        for our task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The dataset was split into 2 files, true news and fake news, with 4 columns:
                        title, text, subject and date.
                        <b>It contains 20826 Real News articles and 17903 Fake News articles.</b>
                        This means our data is relatively balanced.

                        performing data analysis and sentiment analysis before building our Machine Learning and Deep

                        In order to have a good result with the machine learning model,
                        it is important to follow a series of steps, mainly related to the pre-processing of the data:

                    <h3>Pre-process Data</h3>

                    <h4>Process Text</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Target Column: Title. Title words converted into lowercase,
                                removed all stop words and special characters.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Tokenization</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <p>We trialed 2 ways of tokenizing:</p>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Text data was tokenized with <b>RegexpTokenizer()</b> to split strings into substrings
                                using regular expressions.
                                and then a Stemming algorithm <b>PorterStemmer()</b>
                                was used to stem the tokenized words (break down sentences into words).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The text data was tokenized using a <b>Tensforflow Tokenizer</b> library and then
                                sequenced.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Stemmitization</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Stemming algorithm <b>PorterStemmer()</b> was used to stem the tokenized words
                                (break down sentences into words).

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Train-Test Split</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Data was split into Train and Test data to evaluate the performance of our
                                Machine Learning Algorithm.
                            </p>

                    <h4>Vectorize Train and Test Data</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                In NLP, Textual Data needs to be Vectorized because NLP Models can't
                                understand Textual Data, only Numerical Value.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We used <b>CountVectorizer()</b> as the last step in Pre-processing to encode all words
                                and return integer count for the number of times each word occurs in a sentence.

                    <h3>Choosing the best model</h3>
                    <!-- 
                    <p>
                        We used most of the dataset for our visualisations and data exploration but we decided early on to drop the date, 
                        text and subject columns and focus only on the titles of the news pieces rather than the whole text. 
                    </p> 
-->

                    <p>
                        We took a 2 step approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, we implemented <b>6 Binary Classification Algorithms</b> to see
                        if we could accurately predict whether news was fake or real looking at the headlines (titles).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Secondly, we implemented <b>2 different Deep Learning Models</b> to measure their accuracy to
                        detect Fake News.

                                    The <b>Super Vector Machine (SVM) classification had the best score out of the 6
                                        Binary Classification Algorithms</b>
                                    we fitted on our dataset, with an accuracy score of 0.95 and F1 score of 0.95.
                                    The <b>PassiveAgressive Classification</b> was a close second.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    SVM is mostly used for classification problems but can also be used for regression
                                    challenges.
                                    It doesn't perform very well when data has a lot of noise which wasn't an issue
                                    with our data but it took longer than all of the other models to fit as SVM's
                                    required training
                                    time is higher.

                    <p>
                        For the Supervised Learning Model we used a Keras Sequential deep learning model. We created a
                        neural network model and the resulting accuracy was higher than the previous models. This model
                        works best as a binary classifier and additional layers were added to account for the text
                        classification: the Embedding layer converts sequences into arrays of word vectors and the Dense
                        layer classifyies arrays of word vectors.

                    <p>
                        Although, we suspected that the model may have overfitted on the training data due to the low
                        loss rate and high accuracy rate in addition to the slight increase in the validation loss.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to this, this model had a slighlty lower accuracy rate than the Support Vector
                        Machine model.

                        <li>
                            train a SVM model on the same preprocessed data that the NN model was trained on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            run the SVM model fully and compare the loss in addition to the accuracy to the NN model.

                        <li>
                            compile and train a convolutional network model to see how this compares to SVM and NN
                            models.

                    <p>
                        We predict that a Convolutional Network Model would have a higher accuracy and lower error rate.
                        This is because convolutional neural networks automatically detect import features in addition
                        to other advantages over other neural network models.

                    <h4>BERT Model using Tensor-flow's hub</h4>
                    <p>
                        BERT is a new method of pre-training language representations from Google which outperforms
                        previous methods on a variety of NLP tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BERT stands for “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers”. It uses a transformer
                        model, applying the bidirectional training of Transformer using an encoder-decoder architecture.
                        BERT only uses the encoder part of this architecture because its goal is to generate a language
                        model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from splitting the Test and Training data we skipped all the Pre-processing steps in our
                        other Models because we used Tensorflow-hub's BERT preprocessor and encoder.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Result after only 5 epochs:
                    </p>

                    <img src="assets/dataviz/bert-epo.png" width="800px" alt="">

                    <p>
                        The model reached an accuracy level of almost 0.90 and a low loss score of 0.23 on the testing
                        data. The validation accuracy starts to dip slightly after 3 epochs but the BERT Model performed
                        relatively well on Predicting Fake News after just 5 epochs.
                    </p>

                    <img src="assets/dataviz/bert-accu.png" width="600px" alt="">

                    <p>
                        This model was different in that it was designed to predict whether news was Real or Fake by
                        giving it a score between 0 and 1. Like the previous Neural Network model it could be used to
                        create a web application to predict Fake or Real news, where the user could input the title of
                        an article and the application would predict the probability of it being either Real or Fake.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        BERT is quite powerful and is preferred for it's ease of use and how simple it is in quickly
                        building machine learning models and in our case the dataset was probably too small to showcase
                        its total power.

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>

                    <p>
                        We tested our NLP model on completely new unseen data.
                        We chose fake news text and true news text and ran it through our model.
                    </p>

                    <h4>True News Test</h4>

                        This string resulted in a prediction probability of 0.9997772.
                        This therefore tested correctly using our model.
                    </p>

                        This string resuted in a prediction probability of 0.036136717 which tested correctly using our

                        Variations of this text was repeated by Trump 76 times. The implications for democracy is
                        explicit. With this qoute in addition to Trump's insistence that the election was rigged, and
                        the dozens of lawsuits, aims to undermine the democratic process and intensify the emotions of
                        Trump's followers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Indeed, this claim directly led to a mob of Trump supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6
                        while formal certification of Biden's victory was underway (Washington Post, 2022).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Similar actions by past leaders has lead to dire consequences on citizens of nations, world
                        conflicts, and deep mistrust in the democratic process.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                    <p>
                        If fake news could be distinguished from real news then the spread of misinformation would
                        reduce. It would also have positive ramifications for democratic processes, the spread of hate
                        speech, and public safety.
