                    <p>
                        Fake news is misleading information deliberately spread as “news” typically online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is an important difference between fake news and simply inaccurate reporting:
                        fake news implies that the <b>misinformation is absolutely deliberate</b>.

                    <p>
                        If fake news could be distinguished from real news then the spread
                        of misinformation would reduce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is why we have built supervised machine learning models
                        and deep learning models using <b>Natural Language Programming</b> (NLP)
                        to predict whether the news is real or fake.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why Machine Learning?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Biased software on internet and social media platforms has only amplified Fake News 
                        so we decided to use Machine Learning, 
                        specifically NLP algorithms to counteract this. 
                    </p> -->
                    <p>
                        <b>Fake News detection requires only Natural Language Understanding</b>. NLU is
                        a sub-category of NLP that gives computers the ability to understand the meaning
                        of a piece of text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope this technology could be widely used in future to detect and
                        flag fake news and disinformation.

                    <h3>The Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        We used the Fake News Detection dataset from a
                        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaggle's Fake News Detection Competition</a>.
                        And we decided on this dataset as it was the most balanced and complete dataset we could find
                        for our task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The dataset was split into 2 files, true news and fake news, with 4 columns:
                        title, text, subject and date.
                        It contains 20826 Real News articles and 17903 Fake News articles.
                        This means our data is relatively balanced.

                    <p>
                        With over 50,000 rows of data, we began by undergoing data cleansing and data exploration, then
                        performing data analysis and sentiment analysis before building our Machine Learning and Deep
                        Learning models.

                                Text analysis shows an interesting consistency in both sets of data,

                                Originally, Trump claimed he would run for president since the 1980s.
                                Most people believed this to be a publicity stunt.

                        In order to have a good result with the machine learning model,
                        it is important to follow a series of steps, mainly related to the pre-processing of the data:

                    <h3>Pre-process Data</h3>

                    <h4>Process Text</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Target Column: Title. Title words converted into lowercase,
                                removed all stop words and special characters.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Tokenization</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <p>We trialed 2 ways of tokenizing:</p>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Text data was tokenized with <b>RegexpTokenizer()</b> to split strings into substrings
                                using regular expressions.
                                and then a Stemming algorithm <b>PorterStemmer()</b>
                                was used to stem the tokenized words (break down sentences into words).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The text data was tokenized using a <b>Tensforflow Tokenizer</b> library and then
                                sequenced.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Stemmitization</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Stemming algorithm <b>PorterStemmer()</b> was used to stem the tokenized words
                                (break down sentences into words).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Train-Test Split</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Data was split into Train and Test data to evaluate the performance of our
                                Machine Learning Algorithm.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Vectorize Train and Test Data</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                In NLP, Textual Data needs to be Vectorized because NLP Models can't
                                understand Textual Data, only Numerical Value.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                We used <b>CountVectorizer()</b> as the last step in Pre-processing to encode all words
                                and return integer count for the number of times each word occurs in a sentence.

                    <h3>Choosing the best model</h3>
                    <!-- 
                    <p>
                        We used most of the dataset for our visualisations and data exploration but we decided early on to drop the date, 
                        text and subject columns and focus only on the titles of the news pieces rather than the whole text. 
                    </p> 
-->

                    <p>
                        We took a 2 step approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, we implemented <b>6 Binary Classification Algorithms</b> to see
                        if we could accurately predict whether news was fake or real looking at the headlines (titles).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Secondly, we implemented <b>2 different Deep Learning Models</b> to measure their accuracy to
                        detect Fake News.
                    </p>

                                    The <b>Super Vector Machine (SVM) classification had the best score out of the 6
                                        Binary Classification Algorithms</b>
                                    we fitted on our dataset, with an accuracy score of 0.95 and F1 score of 0.95.
                                    The <b>PassiveAgressive Classification</b> was a close second.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    SVM is mostly used for classification problems but can also be used for regression
                                    challenges.
                                    It doesn't perform very well when data has a lot of noise which wasn't an issue
                                    with our data but it took longer than all of the other models to fit as SVM's
                                    required training
                                    time is higher.

                    <p>
                        In our Deep Learning Sequential Model most of the Pre-processing steps in our Machine Learning
                        models were utilized with some minor exceptions. From the Keras library we used the KerasTuner
                        hyperparameter optimization framework to tune our Neural Network and find the best
                        hyperparameter values of our deep learning model.
                    </p>

                    <h4>BERT (Unsupervised) Deep Learning Model</h4>
                    <p>
                        BERT is a new method of pre-training language representations from Google which outperforms
                        previous methods on a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

                        BERT stands for “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers”. It uses a transformer
                        model, applying the bidirectional training of Transformer using an encoder-decoder architecture.
                        BERT only uses the encoder part of this architecture because its goal is to generate a language
                        model.

                    <p>
                        Apart from splitting the Test and Training data we skipped all the Pre-processing steps in our
                        other Models because we used Tensorflow-hub’s BERT preprocessor and encoder.
